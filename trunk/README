INTRODUCTION

  cuecue is a suite (library, command line program, graphical frontend)
  to convert .cue + [.ogg|.flac|.wav|.mp3] to .cue + .bin, in order to
  make them easier to burn with standard burning software.

BUILDING AND INSTALLING

  Before you can build this package, you must first build and install the
  libmad, libflac, libogg and libvorbis packages distributed separately.

Windows Platforms

  cuecue can be built under Windows using either MingW or Cygwin.
  Follow the POSIX build intructions.

POSIX Platforms

  The code is distributed with a 'configure' script that will generate for
  you a 'Makefile' in each of the subdirectories that
  require them. See the file 'INSTALL' for generic instructions.

  The specific options you may want to give 'configure' are:


      --disable-flac
      --disable-ogg
      --disable-mp3

  Other options are available, run 'configure --help' to get a list.
